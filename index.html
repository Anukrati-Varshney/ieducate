                shared narratives and the exclusion of narratives that lead to alienation and divisiveness. What makes
                public schools public is not so much that the schools have common goals but that the students have
                common gods. The reason for this is that public education does not serve a public. It creates a

                programs are conducted by MNCs for professionals across the globe and employees are able to acquire
                important skills while sitting in a board room, or by having seminars, which are conducted for employees
                of the same or the different organizations under one roof. The schools which use E-learning technologies
                are a step ahead of those which still have the traditional approach towards learning. </P>

            <P class="sectionsubtag text-small">A learning system based on formalised teaching but with the help of
                electronic resources is known as E-learning. While teaching can be based in or out of the classrooms,
                the use of computers and the Internet forms the major component of E-learning. E-learning can also be
                termed as a network enabled transfer of skills and knowledge, and the delivery of education is made to a
                large number of recipients at the same or different times. Earlier, it was not accepted wholeheartedly
                as it was assumed that this system lacked the human element required in learning.E-learning has proved
                to be the best means in the corporate sector, especially when training programs are conducted by MNCs
                for professionals across the globe and employees are able to acquire important skills while sitting in a

                place in the classrooms for learning. Books are gradually getting replaced by electronic educational
                materials like optical discs or pen drives. Knowledge can also be shared via the Internet, which is
